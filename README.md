# Rental Price Prediction
This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook that does EDA on a __short-term rentals__ dataset, does feature engineering, and based on these, builds an __XGBoost__ model that predicts short-term rentals. The EDA includes __ANOVA__, visualizations, a __PCA__ to see if we can reduce the dimensions, and __linearity tests__ to see how we whould build the XGBoost model. At the end, the model predictions are visualised to see if the model is able to predict prices across the range of the feature.
